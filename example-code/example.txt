This code will open a file named example.txt, move to the 10th byte, and read the next 5 bytes from there. It's important to handle errors such as failure to open the file, failure to move to the specified location, and failure to read the specified number of bytes.

Also, don't forget to include error handling in your actual implementation, and ensure that any resources (like opened files or allocated memory) are properly released or closed when they are no longer needed.
